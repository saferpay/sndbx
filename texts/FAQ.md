# F.A.Q

## Can I use my test account on the live system?

No, the test and live systems are completely separate from each other. No data exchange takes place.

## Can I use real card details in the test environment?

No, the use of real card details is not possible and will generate an error.

## Which functions are available in the test system?

On the test system, all Saferpay functions are available. Saferpay Business is usually switched off for test accounts. For this reason, it is important that you decide in advance whether or not you will also be using the business features in live operations later on.

## Which payment methods can I test?

Currently, the following payment methods are available:

+ SEPA Direct Debit (Currency EUR only)
+	PayPal
+	American Express
+	Diners Club
+	JCB
+	Mastercard
+	myOne
+	Shopping Bonus Card
+	VISA
+	Masterpass Wallet 
+ Additional payment methods can be made available on demand. For this, please contact the [Saferpay Integration Team](mailto:integration.saferpay@six-payment-services.com?subject=Additional%20payment%20methods).

## What currencies are available in the test system?

By default, EUR and CHF are enabled on test accounts. Other currencies can be activated on demand. For this, please contact the [Saferpay Integration Team](mailto:integration.saferpay@six-payment-services.com?subject=Test%20Account%20Currencies).

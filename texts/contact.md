    <li>2. Please tell us, if you are using the test- or live-system.</li>
    <li>3. Our servers log your activity on API-Side. Those logs make it easier for us to understand, what exactly you are trying to achieve and can help to easily identify your problem. Please note however, that the logfiles are only saved for 14 days.</li>
    <li>4. If available, tell us the transactionId of the transaction you had problems with. This way we can find it instantly.</li>
    <li>5. If you don't have an Id, then give us a timestamp, so we can pinpoint the timeframe, where you had your problem.</li>

  <p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> Make sure that you <strong>NEVER</strong> accidently submit your real Card Details via E-Mail -Be it by Text or Screenshot-, when contacting us! If the mail is intercepted, or your mail service provder is hacked, then your card details will be leaked to the public! You can submit the last four numbers of your PAN however, which -in most cases- is sufficient, to identify it, but not to do harmful actions to you and your bank-account! However still, you should keep even those to a minimum, or avoid it alltogether, if possible!</p>
